# Description:
# This is a GitHub Actions workflow file for building and releasing a vscode extension.
# The workflow is triggered on push events to the master branch (pull-request included) or when a versioned tag is pushed.
# One Job is divided into three sub-jobs: build, deploy, and release. In a way to practice the CI/CD process, the three sub-jobs are separated.
# Having the three sub-jobs separated pushes you to use environment variables to share data between jobs.
